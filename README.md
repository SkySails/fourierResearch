# Fourier Research Program
A simple HTML web-development project, aiming to give an easy insight into the mathematical fenomenon [Fourier series](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html).

## The interface
The interface is designed to be easy-to-use, while enabling the user to change all of the aspects in the animation:
* `Time progression`, equal to the speed of the animation.
* The `thetafactor` for the equation, equal to the amount of rings generated on the rotating axis.
* A pause button for easy analysis of the wave. Handy to visualize [Gibbs phenomenon﻿](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon﻿) for example.
